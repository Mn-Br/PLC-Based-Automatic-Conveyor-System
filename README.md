# PLC-Based-Automatic-Conveyor-System

This project details the design, implementation, and evaluation of a PLC-based Automatic Conveyor System, engineered to enhance the sorting, processing, and transportation of products within industrial settings. Utilizing adequate sensors, the system accurately identifies product locations, ensuring precise sorting based on predefined criteria. The incorporation of various inputs, counters, timers, and outputs allows for meticulous control over the conveyor belts’ machinery. The system employs Siemens' SIMATIC STEP7 for PLC programming, leveraging its robust capabilities for system logic and communication tasks. This project not only demonstrates the system’s efficiency and reliability but also underscores the pivotal role of PLC programming in advancing industrial automation technology.
